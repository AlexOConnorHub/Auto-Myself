# Auto Myself

**Auto Myself** uses [Sentry](https://Sentry.io) for anonymous reporting. There is no personally identifiable information (PII) collected. It is an opt-in feature, meaning you must confirm you want to send crash reports. You can also choose to disable this feature at any time in the app settings. For more details on how Sentry handles data, please see [Sentry's Privacy Policy](https://sentry.io/privacy/).

This privacy policy may change in the future, and any changes will be reflected in the app and on this page. It is recommended to check back periodically for updates.
