# MyCar-TotalControl

This is a mobile app written in React Native for taking control of vehicle maintainance.

## Build

- `npm install`
- `npx expo prebuild`
- `npx expo run:android`

## TODO

- [ ] Add sync from WatermelonDB to Supabase
  - [ ] Write Postgres functions to sync data. While it's more work, I believe it would be more secure. This should also make supporting family accounts easier/safer.
- [ ] Pop-up menu
  - [ ] On long press themed
  - [ ] Consistant for cars and maintainaces
