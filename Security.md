# Security

Please e-mail [AlexOConnorHub](mailto:security@alexoconnor.us) if you have any security concerns. If reporting a security vulnerability, I would personally ask that you give reasonable time for the vulnerability to be fixed before disclosing it to the public. I will do my best to fix the vulnerability as soon as possible. Generally 30 days is a reasonable amount of time to fix a vulnerability, but this may vary depending on the severity of the vulnerability and how difficult it is to fix.
